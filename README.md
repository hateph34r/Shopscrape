#Shopscrape

Shopscrape is a Python 3 app that will iterate through a CSV that contains shopping area names and addresses and create a Google Search to find and save PDF footprint maps of the given shopping area, using Chromedriver as the browser. This was an R&D prototype to find alternate methods of verifying spatial data.
